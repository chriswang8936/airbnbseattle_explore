# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using the Seattle Airbnb Data from 2016provided by kaggle to better understand:

When is the best time to visit Seattle?
Is the Airbnb in Seattle occupied by some big host with many listings, or it's more like small business?
Is the type of house impacting the price?
# File Descriptions
Seattle_Airbnb_Data (folder)

This contains the source files for this project. The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset:
Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day
Project_1_Seattle (Jupyter Source File)

This is the Jupyter notebook conducts all the analysis
# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

# Acknowledgements
The raw data source comes from kaggle.
